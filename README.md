Hello, I’m Yazalde Filimone.

I'm a enginher based in Mozambique. I'm interested in frontend, compilers, OS enginher and computer ciencie.

I'm currently working at A4pm, We focus on ensuring that our systems save and educate as many lives as possible.

Previously, I followed my coding journey using a [sangung cellphone](https://www.samsung.com/ph/smartphones/others/galaxy-grand-prime-white-8gb-sm-g530hzwdxtc/)  and using [termux](https://termux.dev/en/) terminal emulation.

How far it can take me? Just a young introvert who likes coding and books.
