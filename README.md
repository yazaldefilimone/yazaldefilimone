Hello, Iâ€™m Yazalde Filimone, an engineer based in [Mozambique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique). 

Many things capture my interest, such as the web, compilers, math, distributed systems, unix systems, computer science and other stuffs!

I'm currently working at A4pm ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, We focus on ensuring that our systems save and educate as many lives as possible.

Previously, I followed my coding journey using a [sangung cellphone](https://www.samsung.com/ph/smartphones/others/galaxy-grand-prime-white-8gb-sm-g530hzwdxtc/)  and using [termux](https://termux.dev/en/) terminal emulation.

How far it can take me? Just a young introvert who likes coding and books.
