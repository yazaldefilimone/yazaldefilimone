Hello, Iâ€™m Yazalde Filimone.

I'm a enginher based in [Mozambique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozambique). I'm interested in web, compilers, os engineer, math, distributed systems, unix systems and computer science.

I'm currently working at A4pm ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, We focus on ensuring that our systems save and educate as many lives as possible.

Previously, I followed my coding journey using a [sangung cellphone](https://www.samsung.com/ph/smartphones/others/galaxy-grand-prime-white-8gb-sm-g530hzwdxtc/)  and using [termux](https://termux.dev/en/) terminal emulation.

How far it can take me? Just a young introvert who likes coding and books.
