Hello, Iâ€™m Yazalde Filimone.

I'm a enginher based in Mozambique. I'm interested in compilers, os enginher, web engineering, dev experience and under engineering.

I'm currently working at A4pm, build scalable systems, We focus on ensuring that our systems save and educate as many lives as possible.

Previously, I follow my coding journey using a sangung mobile and using termux terminal emulation.

How far it can take me. Just a young introvert who likes coding and books.
